# russo-Ukrainian-War-Analysis

The primary objective of this research is to perform a detailed analysis of russian casualties so far, represented in a time-series form and to provide the
statistical testing of two following hypotheses:
1. **Weather** (temperature, pressure, cloudiness and wind speed) **influence** on the russian
casualties.
2. **Validity** of the russo-Ukrainian war **breakdown into multiple phases** based on the
military activities (measured in casualties scale).

Additionaly, there is a task to test the models for making the predictions, if any
correlation between russian losses and weather conditions would be found. After the
experementing, the goal is to find the best model, tune its parameters and discuss why
other failed.
